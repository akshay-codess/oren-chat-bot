### What is BRSR?
BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting) is a framework introduced by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 2021. It mandates the top 1,000 listed companies in India to disclose quantifiable metrics on sustainability-related factors.

The framework requires companies to respond to 140 questions, divided into:
- 98 essential indicators (mandatory)
- 42 leadership indicators (voluntary)

The disclosure requirements are grouped into nine core principles based on the National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct:

1. Conducting business with integrity, in an ethical, transparent and accountable manner
2. Providing sustainable and safe goods and services
3. Respecting and promoting employee well-being
4. Respecting stakeholder interests and being responsive
5. Respecting and promoting human rights
6. Respecting and promoting the environment
7. Engaging in responsible and transparent public policy advocacy
8. Promoting inclusive growth and equitable development
9. Engaging with and providing value to customers responsibly

### BRSR Core
BRSR Core represents a subset of the BRSR, consisting of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across 9 ESG attributes, with compliance timelines:

- FY 2023-24: Top 150 listed entities must provide "reasonable assurance" on BRSR Core KPIs
- FY 2024-25: Top 250 listed entities must provide "reasonable assurance" on BRSR Core KPIs, including for their value chain
- FY 2025-26: Top 500 listed entities must provide "reasonable assurance" on BRSR Core KPIs, including for their value chain

4. Use the comment thread for:
